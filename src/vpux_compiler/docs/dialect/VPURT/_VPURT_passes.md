### `-assign-physical-barriers`: Assign physical barriers
This pass replaces virtual barriers with physical barriers and assign IDs to them.

#### Options
```
-num-barriers : Number of physical barriers, available for use
```
### `-barrier-simulation`: Simulate barriers
Simulates the physical barrier execution and stops compilation on fail.
### `-inference-execution-analysis`: Perform inference execution simulation to visualize schedule
Simulate the schedule generated by the compiler and using the cost model visualize inference execution.
### `-reduce-exceeding-active-count-barriers`: Reduce exceeding active barrier count
This pass linearizes virtual barriers in the IR such that the number of active barriers at any time
does not exceed the physical number of available barriers and that total producer + consumer variant 
count <= MAX_VARIANT_COUNT.
With exceeding active barrier count:
- parallel barriers can be merged
- parallel consumers to barrier can be linearized
- parallel barriers can be linearized
If nothing can be applied extreme linearization will be performed, where all tasks linked to active barriers
will be linearized. 

#### Options
```
-num-barriers      : Number of physical barriers, available for use
-max-variant-count : Number of producer and consumer slots per barrier, available for use
```
### `-satisfy-one-wait-barrier-per-task`: Satisfy each task has one wait barrier
This pass will satisfy barrier safety constraint
-- single barrier drives each task
Handling multi barrier input can be wasteful and considerably more difficult to manage 
barrier safety. Pass is manipulating tasks with parallel wait barriers by two modes:
1. Merge parallel wait barriers with legal barrier variant count
2. Linearize parallel wait barrier producers with exceeding variant count

#### Options
```
-max-variant-count : Number of producer and consumer slots per barrier, available for use
```
### `-split-exceeding-variant-count-barriers`: Split exceeding variant (producer and consumer) count barriers
This pass splits virtual barriers in the IR such that the number of producer solts <= MAX_VARIANT_COUNT / 2 
and the number of consumer slots <= MAX_VARIANT_COUNT / 2. Ensuring that each barrier will satisfy condition: 
total producer + consumer variant count <= MAX_VARIANT_COUNT.

#### Options
```
-max-variant-count : Number of producer and consumer slots per barrier, available for use
```
