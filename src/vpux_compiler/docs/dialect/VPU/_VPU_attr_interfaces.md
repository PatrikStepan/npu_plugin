## SEAttr (`VPU_SEAttrInterface`)

Interface for Storage Elements attributes.

### Methods:
#### `inferOutputShape`

```c++
vpux::Shape inferOutputShape(vpux::ShapeRef inputShape);
```
Infer the output shape that is obtained after applying the transformation
represented by the attribute over the input shape.

For example, a nearest-neighbor interpolate attribute with scale 2 for data
which has a [1, 16, 3, 3] shape would return the [1, 16, 6, 6] shape.

If tensor associated with the attribute was tiled then tile shape will be returned.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `backInferShape`

```c++
vpux::Shape backInferShape(vpux::ShapeRef outputShape);
```
Get input shape for a given output shape.

For example, a nearest-neighbor interpolate attribute with scale 2 for data
which has a [1, 16, 3, 3] shape would return the [1, 16, 6, 6] shape. 
Then this function will return [1, 16, 3, 3].
NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `backInferCoord`

```c++
vpux::Shape backInferCoord(vpux::ShapeRef tileOffset, vpux::ShapeRef inputShape);
```
This method provides facility to find coordinates of input pixel/value
that is used to produce output value with given coordinates.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `extractTile`

```c++
vpux::VPU::SEAttr extractTile(vpux::ShapeRef outputTileOffset, vpux::ShapeRef outputTileShape, vpux::ShapeRef inputShape, vpux::Shape&inputTileOffset, vpux::Shape&inputTileShape);
```
This method extracts input and output tile based on output tile offsets and shape.
It returns updated attribute since tiling may affect attribute parameters.

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.

#### `computeSEOffsets`

```c++
std::vector<int32_t> computeSEOffsets(vpux::ShapeRef dataShape, vpux::StridesRef dataStrides, vpux::Byte elemSize, int64_t seSize);
```
Computes the Storage Element offsets for the given input data after applying
the transformation represented by the current attribute.

For example, let's take an example of a nearest-neighbor interpolate attribute
with scale 2 for data which has a 1x16x3x3xui8 type, compact strides and the
Storage Element size of 16. The addresses of each Storage Element for the data are:
0x0   0x10  0x20
0x30  0x40  0x50
0x60  0x70  0x80

The resulting offsets would be:
0x0   0x0   0x10  0x10  0x20  0x20
0x0   0x0   0x10  0x10  0x20  0x20
0x30  0x30  0x40  0x40  0x50  0x50
0x30  0x30  0x40  0x40  0x50  0x50
0x60  0x60  0x70  0x70  0x80  0x80
0x60  0x60  0x70  0x70  0x80  0x80

NOTE: This method *must* be implemented by the user.
