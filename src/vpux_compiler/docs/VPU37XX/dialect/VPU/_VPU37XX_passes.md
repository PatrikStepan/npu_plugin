### `-adjust-for-optimized-sw-kernel`: Adjust shape or layout of sw ops to leverage optimized kernel implementation
The pass adjusts the shape or layout of software ops to better leverage optimized shave
implementation
Supported Optimizations:
- Softmax:
  * Axis0: Adjust shape to leverage the optimized kernel for softmax with axis=0
  * MultiShave: Adjust shape to gather dimensions in the tile dimension to utilize more shave engines
### `-decompose-gather`: Decompose gather into gatherSlice and ExtractValue
The pass can Decompose gather into gatherSlice and ExtractValue when can't get feasible tiling strategy.
### `-split-real-dft-ops`: Replace RDFT and IRDFT operations with a subgraph of smaller operations
Replace RDFT and IRDFT operations with a subgraph of smaller operations.
VPU.RDFT = {VPU.RDFTUncutOp->VPU.SliceOp}
VPU.IRDFT = {VPU.IDFTOp->VPU.IRDFTLastAxisOp}
